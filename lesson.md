# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

Create the conda environment based on the `environment.yml` file.

### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we will be learning about neural networks and deep learning. We will learn about the foundational models of neural networks- perceptron and multi-layer perceptron (fully connected neural network). We will then build a fully connected neural network model for classification using PyTorch.

## Part 1 - Neural Network and Deep Learning

We will be using the `notebooks/neural_network_deep_learning_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson.

> 1. Activate the environement `conda activate dl`.
> 2. Run `jupyter notebook`.
> 3. In the notebook, open `notebooks/neural_network_deep_learning_lesson.ipynb`.
> 4. Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
